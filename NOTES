Day 01 Review:
HTML:
-Mark-up language
-Use html tags to create elements
   -h1-h6 -> header
   -p -> paragraph
   -Opening : <h1>
   -Closing : </h1>
   -Example: <h1>  My Webpage </h1>
-CSS: Cascading Style Sheet
-It is used for add style such as color, width, height, spacings, ...
-3 ways to use CSS
   -1.Inline : <h1 style="color: red" > My Webpage </h1>
   -2.Internal: By using style tag in the same HTML file
   <style>
       h1{
         color: red
        }
    </style>
    3.External: By creating an external CSS sheet.
                In styles.css, we can use css files without using <style> keyword
                h1{
                   color: red
                   }
NOTE: 1.external styling is preferred since it makes the code clean
      2.We shoudl not use tags for styling. Class is the most common way for styling
      -Class is used for styling for multiple elements.Class can repeat. "." means class
      -Id is used for styling unique elements. "#" means id in html
